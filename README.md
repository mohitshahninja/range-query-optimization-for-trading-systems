# Range Query Optimization for Trading Systems

## Overview

This project implements the Segment Tree data structure optimized for efficient range queries and point updates. Segment Trees are fundamental in the design of low-latency trading systems, where fast data aggregation and real-time query resolution are critical for competitive advantage.

This repository lays the groundwork for advanced data structure research applicable to:

- Market microstructure modeling
- Real-time financial data analysis
- High-frequency trading (HFT) infrastructure

## Why Segment Trees Matter in Trading

In electronic trading, the ability to quickly compute aggregated market data (like order book depths, VWAPs, and spreads) over dynamic intervals is crucial. Segment Trees provide logarithmic time complexity for these operations, enabling faster decision-making and lower latencies in execution algorithms.
